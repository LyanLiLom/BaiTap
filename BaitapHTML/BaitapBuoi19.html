    <span style="color: #9c1212;">Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant.
    </span><br>
    <span style="color: #9c1212;">The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.  </span><br>
    <span style="color: #9c1212;">The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world.
    </span><br>
    <span style="color: #9c1212;">Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa.</span><br>
    <span style="color: #9c1212;"> The two most commonly grown are arabica and robusta.
    </span><br>
    <span style="color: #9c1212;">Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, processed, and dried.</span><br>
    <span style="color: #9c1212;">Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor.</span><br>
    <span style="color: #9c1212;">Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water to produce coffee as a beverage.</span>
